# Welcome to the Bogo Project!

## Background
From Wikipedia: Bogosort is a particularly ineffective sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm.

## Purpose
We wanted to build a webapp that allowed you to sign up for email/text notifications for a BogoParty. Essentially, this server would run the bogo algorithm (using python) and send out an alert when the sorting algorithm completed. Sorting is optimized to finish every 45 days or so.

## Components
- MySQL database to store emails, usernames, etc.

- PHP used to handle forms.

- NGINX will be used as a reverse proxy and will serve static content

- Supervisor will be used to run our python script on startup

- Python will be used for the Bogosort code

> Components will be added as development occurs. The above are also currently suggestions and not set in stone. 

## Installation
None yet.

## Project Status
Mostly completed unless we think of anything else to add.

## How to Contribute
Pull requests welcome. Currently, this project is based in Waterloo and is being built in the spare time of the South 8 BogoBoyz ;)

###### The end result of this project has little practicality, but is intended to be a fun way for anyone interested to improve their Python, Linux, and Web Development skills. The journey is the destination.
